# Papyrus

Welcome to Papyrus, my second brain. This repository contains all the notes I have taken down ever since I read Building a Second Brain by Tiago Forte. My preffered note taking app is Obsidian.

I publish my notes online using Quartz v4. Quartz v4 is an amazing set of tools developed by Jacky Zhao to help publish notes online for free. It was built with Obsidian in mind. You can read the Quartz documentation at: https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/.
