* A CD is a savings-type account that earns a fixed interest for a fixed period.
* The principal in a CD should remain untouched for the period of the CD.
  * Any withdrawal of money will lead to a penalty.
* CDs offer fixed, safe, and generally federally insured (up to 250,000).
* CDs don’t offer the growth potential of equity or debt investments.
* CD interest taxes are not on maturity, but when the bank gives you the interest.
* Check early withdrawal penalty (EWP) and make sure it does not touch your principal.

 > \[!Warning\]
 > Missing the bank’s deadline for instructing it on how to handle the proceeds of your maturing CD can lead to involuntarily locking yourself into a subpar rate for years to come, or incurring an unwanted—and potentially hefty—early withdrawal penalty because you waited too long before extracting your funds.

Opening a CD will lock you in - 

1. Interest Rate
1. Term (ends on maturity date - date on which money can be withdrawn from CD without penalty)
1. Principal
1. Institution

 > When choosing the CD term, pay attention to the Fed’s rate-setting movements and plans. Opening a long-term CD right before a Fed rate hike can hurt your future earnings, while expectations of decreasing rates can signal a good time to lock in a long-term rate.
