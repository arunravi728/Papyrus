 > Mindfulness is about living in the present. Doesn't matter if you do it well. All that matters is that you are doing it.

* Most of the time, the current moment is alright.
  * We can make that moment horrible by thinking of the past or the future.
* Check and notice how you feel throughout the day!
  * Observing how emotions impact your body from a third person's perspective.

### Primary and Secondary Emotions

* Primary Emotions - First reaction to an event.
  * They are temporary.
* Secondary Emotions - These are generally reactions to your secondary emotions.
* Emotions are not good or bad. They just are. It's human to have negative emotions.
* There is no right way to feel! Remembering how you feel is not under your control.
  * You can only control what you do when you experience these strong emotions
  * This is called **Acceptance** - helps stay in the present.
* Observe which emotions show up, and what reactionary emotions show up.
