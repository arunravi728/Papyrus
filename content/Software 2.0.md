 > Neural networks are not just another classifier, they represent the beginning of a fundamental shift in how we develop software. They are Software 2.0.

##### Approach to Software 2.0

1. Specify some goal on the behavior of a desirable program.
1. Write skeleton code that identifies a subset of program space to search (neural nets).
1. For neural networks, we restrict the search to a continuous subset of the program space. 
   * The search process can be made efficient with backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent.

##### Components of Software 2.0

1. Dataset that defines desirable behavior.
1. Neural network architecture without the weights.

In most applications, the NN architecture is standardized, making work on data sets critical.

##### Examples

1. Visual Recognition
1. Speech Recognition
1. Speech Synthesis
1. Machine Translation

##### Benefits

1. Computational Homogeneity - Compared to traditional software, software 2.0 has only two major operations - matrix multiplication and ReLU.
1. Easier to integrate into hardware - This is a by-product of a simple instruction set.
1. Constant running time and memory use.
1. It is highly portable and agile.

##### Limitations

1. It's every hard to tell how these networks work.
1. They can have silent biases that are very hard to identify and remove.
