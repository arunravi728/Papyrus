 > Neural networks are not just another classifier; they represent the beginning of a fundamental shift in how we develop software. They are Software 2.0.

### Approach to Software 2.0

1. Specify a goal for the behavior of a desirable program.
1. Write skeleton code that identifies a subset of program space to search (neural nets).
1. For neural networks, we restrict the search to a continuous subset of the program space. 
   * The search process is carried out with backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent.

### Components of Software 2.0

1. A dataset that defines desirable behavior.
1. Neural network architecture without the weights.

In most applications, the NN architecture is standardized, making work on data sets critical.

### Examples

1. Visual Recognition
1. Speech Recognition
1. Speech Synthesis
1. Machine Translation

### Benefits

1. Computational Homogeneity - Compared to traditional software, software 2.0 has only two major operations: matrix multiplication and ReLU.
1. Easier to integrate into hardware - This is a by-product of a simple instruction set.
1. Constant running time and memory use.
1. It is highly portable and agile.

### Limitations

1. It's hard to tell how these networks work.
1. They can have silent biases that are very hard to identify and remove.
