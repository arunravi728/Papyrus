 > 
 > Doing well with money has little to do with how smart you are and a lot to do with how you behave.

The story of Ronald Read, the gas station attendant turned millionaire philanthropist, stresses the following - 

1. Financial outcomes can be driven by luck.
1. How you behave is more important than what you know.

##### Experience Matters

In theory, investments decisions should be made based on goals and options available at the time. This, however, is not what people do. People make investment decisions based on what they have experienced before.

 > 
 > Individual investors' willingness to bear risk depends on personal history.

* Most topics don't have black and white answers. 
* Different experiences can lead to vastly different views on a topic.

##### Role of Luck

Luck and risk are doppelgÃ¤ngers: both are reminders of external forces affecting all decisions. They both exist because the world is too complex to let 100% of your actions dictate a 100% of your outcomes.

When learning from investment strategies of others, it is very hard to distinguish which outcome is due to luck, and which outcome is due to skill. Thus it is prudent to focus less on individual case studies, and focus more on generalized broad patterns.

 > 
 > Not all success is due to hard work. Not all failures are because of laziness.

Success is a lousy teacher. When things are going well remember, the same luck that pushed you forward can also shoot you in the face.
