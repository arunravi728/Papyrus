Self Link: [The Psychology of Money](The%20Psychology%20of%20Money.md)

 > 
 > Doing well with money has little to do with how smart you are and a lot to do with your behavior.

The story of Ronald Read, the gas station attendant turned millionaire philanthropist, stresses that financial well-being has more to do with how you behave than what you know.

 > 
 > \[!Quote\] Voltaire's Observation
 > History never repeats itself; man always does.

### Experience Matters

In theory, investment decisions should be based on the individual's goals and the characteristics of available options. However, this is different from what people do. People make investment decisions based on their past experiences.

 > 
 > Individual investors' willingness to bear risk depends on personal history.

* Most topics don't have black-and-white answers. 
* Different experiences can lead to vastly different views on a topic.

### Role of Luck

Luck and risk are doppelgängers. Both remind us of external forces affecting all decisions. They both exist because the world is too complex to let 100% of one's actions dictate 100% of one's outcomes.

When learning from the investment strategies of others, it can be challenging to distinguish which outcome is due to luck and which is due to skill. Thus, focusing less on individual case studies and more on generalized broad patterns is prudent.

 > 
 > Not all success is due to hard work. Not all failures are because of laziness.

Success is a lousy teacher. When things are going well, remember that the luck that pushed you forward can also shoot you in the face.

### The Beauty of Having Enough

There are many invaluable things in the world — happiness, peace of mind, friends, family, reputation, freedom, and independence. No amount of money can or should replace any of these. Thus, taking excess risk to harm any of these makes no sense.

 > 
 > Happiness is just results minus expectations.

1. The most challenging financial skill is saying you have enough.
1. Accept you might have enough, even if it's less than those around you.
1. Saying you had enough is not the same as being conservative.
1. Many things are not worth risking, no matter the gain.

 > 
 > \[!Quote\] Warren Buffet
 > There is no reason to risk what you have and need for what you don't have and don't need.
