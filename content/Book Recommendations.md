My favorite kinds of books feature complex characters set in intricate worlds. I am currently reading *The Sword of Kaigen*, written by *M. L. Wang*. I got introduced to fantasy and sci-fi stories through the *Inheritance Cycle*, written by *Christopher Paolini*, in middle school. I have since read a multitude of sci-fi and fantasy books, and some of my favorites are - 

* The Cosmere by Brandon Sanderson
* Discworld by Terry Pratchett
* The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams
* The First Law Trilogy by Joe Abercrombie

I am currently reading - 

* The Sword of Kaigen by M. L. Wang
* The Expanse by James S. A. Corey

My rough TBR for the next year or two is  - 

* The Wheel of Time by Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson
* The Three-Body Problem by Cixin Liu
* Dungeon Crawler Carl by Matt Dinniman
* Books by Octavia E. Butler

Apart from sci-fi and fantasy, I also read a plethora of non-fiction books, some of my recommendations are - 

* [Building a Second Brain](./Building%20a%20Second%20Brain.md) by Tiago Forte
* Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari
* Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson
* Debt: The First 5000 Years by David Graeber
