### Introduction

* Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) helps us harness what we know.
* [Second Brain](./Second%20Brain.md) - A digital archive of your knowledge. Similar to [Zettelkasten](./Zettelkasten.md).

### Where It All Started

* Write Things Down!!!
* Human Capital is the knowledge embodied in humans.

### What Is A Second Brain

* [Poverty of Attention](./Poverty%20of%20Attention.md) is a result of instant access to information through the internet.
* Historically, people noted things down in a [Common Place Book](./Common%20Place%20Book.md).

### How A Second Brain Works

* Creativity is the process of connecting seemingly unconnected ideas.
* The three stages of PKM are - Remembering, Connecting, and Creating.
* [CODE](./CODE.md) - Capture, Organize, Distill & Express

### [Capture](./Capture.md) - Keep What Resonates

* A knowledge asset is a crystallization of ideas that promises future value.
* In any piece of content, value is not equally distributed.
* [Externalize Your Thoughts](./Externalize%20Your%20Thoughts.md) to reap the rewards of writing things down.

### [Organize](./Organize.md) - Save For Actionability

* Cathedral Effect - Our environment shapes our thinking.
* [PARA](./PARA.md) - Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives.

### [Distill](./Distill.md) - Find the Essence

* Discoverability is the best way to make notes helpful.
* While deciding what to keep, we also have to decide what not to.
* Every bit of attention you invest should create value.

### [Express](./Express.md) - Show Your Work

* As a knowledge worker, attention/time is our most scarce resource.
* Creativity thrives on examples and templates.

### The Art Of Creative Execution

* The creative process is ancient and unchanging.
* A second brain allows standardization of work.
* [Hemmingway Bridge](./Hemmingway%20Bridge.md) - Use yesterday's momentum today.

### The Essential Habits of Digital Organizers

* Creativity arises when we are organized and efficient.
* Periodic reviews help maintain your working environment.
* Any system that needs to be perfect to be reliable is deeply flawed.

### The Path To Self Expression

* View information through a lens of abundance - more is not always better.
* An idea wants to be shared. Knowledge gets more valuable as it multiplies.
