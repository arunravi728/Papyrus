Self Link: [Systems Over Goals](Systems%20Over%20Goals.md)

* Success depends on your systems, not goals.
  * Both successful and unsuccessful people have the same goals.
  * The difference is the systems/processes employed.
* Goals are temporary changes. Systems lead to long-term repeatable changes.
* Focusing on goals leads to abandoning the process after the goal is achieved.
  * The purpose of goals is to win the game.
  * The purpose of a system is to continue playing.
* You do not rise to the level of your goals, but fall to the level of your systems.

 > It is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress.

[Building a Second Brain](./Building%20a%20Second%20Brain.md) talks about how maintaining a system to take notes and manage knowledge can help produce more creative outputs. It also says creativity is a product of the creative process.
