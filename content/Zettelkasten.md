### Overview

* It originates from a system of writing on index cards.
* These cards would be grouped into various boxes meant for a specific purpose. 
* Each of these cards would be linked to other cards through an index number.

### Types of Notes

* Zettelkasten has 3 different types of notes - 
  1. Fleeting Note - Raw data, not distilled (very similar to the daily note).
  1. Literature Note - A traditional note, with a lot of data about a specific topic.
  1. Permanent Note - Very distilled, summarizes a single idea in a few sentences.

Also refer [Second Brain](./Second%20Brain.md) idea of note-taking. This is the method I follow.
