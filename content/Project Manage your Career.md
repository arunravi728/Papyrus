These are my notes on attending a talk given by a Google career coach on how to treat your career like a project.

### Initiate

* Define the scope of what you are trying to achieve.
* It is generally guided by motivation.
* Also, define the success criteria.

### Create a Next Move Objective

* The objective should be -
  1. Specific
  1. Measurable
  1. Actionable
  1. Relevant
  1. Time-bound.
* Break down all these objectives into bite-sized chunks.

### Execute

* Have a well-managed calendar.
* Have a robust [Note Taking](Note%20Taking.md) system in place.
* Grow your network.
