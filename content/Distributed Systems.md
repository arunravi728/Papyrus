I am currently reading [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](./Designing%20Data-Intensive%20Applications.md) by Martin Kleppmann and [Understanding Distributed Systems](./Understanding%20Distributed%20Systems.md) by Roberto Vitillo. I am also watching relevant lectures from  [MIT OCW - MIT 6.824](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrw6a1wE39_tb2fErI4-WkMbsvGQk9_UB&feature=shared) and [Martin Kleppmann](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeKd45zvjcDFUEv_ohr_HdUFe97RItdiB&feature=shared).

Some interesting topics to explore -
