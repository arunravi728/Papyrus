I took the following 2 free online courses on Distributed Systems during my second year at Google - 

1. [MIT OCW - MIT 6.824](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrw6a1wE39_tb2fErI4-WkMbsvGQk9_UB&feature=shared)
1. [Martin Kleppmann](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeKd45zvjcDFUEv_ohr_HdUFe97RItdiB&feature=shared)

I also read the book [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](./Designing%20Data-Intensive%20Applications.md) by Martin Kleppmann.

The reasons to use distributed systems - 

1. Parallelism / Scalability
1. Fault Tolerance
1. Security / Isolation

Some interesting topics to explore -

1. [MapReduce](./MapReduce.md)
1. [Threads](./Threads.md)
