I took the following 2 free online courses of Distributes Systems during my second year at Google - 

1. [MIT OCW - MIT 6.824](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrw6a1wE39_tb2fErI4-WkMbsvGQk9_UB&feature=shared)
1. [Martin Kleppmann](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeKd45zvjcDFUEv_ohr_HdUFe97RItdiB&feature=shared)

I also read the book *Understanding Distributed Systems* by Roberto Vitillo. The book is more for entry level engineers which focusses on breadth rather than depth.

The reasons to use distributed systems - 

1. Parallelism / Scalability
1. Fault Tolerance
1. Security / Isolation

Some interesting topics to explore - 

1. [Infrastructure](./Infrastructure.md)
1. [Map Reduce](./Map%20Reduce.md)
1. [RPCs and Threads](RPCs%20and%20Threads.md)
