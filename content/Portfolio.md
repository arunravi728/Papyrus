### About Me

Hello! I’m Arun Ravi, a software engineer passionate about exploring the intricate interplays between hardware and software within large-scale distributed systems. I’m currently part of Google’s engineering team, where I develop system daemons that drive the networking backbone of Google’s global compute infrastructure.

Outside of work, I’m an avid reader and passionate cyclist, clocking miles on my road bike whenever I can. I also play badminton (enthusiastically, if not expertly!) and love catching waves on California’s beaches every chance I get.

If you’d like to connect, whether for collaborations, a chat about tech, or a conversation over coffee and a good book, feel free to reach out! I’m always open to connecting with others over shared passions and new ideas.
