##### About Me

I'm Arun Ravi, a software engineer, deeply interested in understanding the interplay of hardware and software in large scale distributed systems. Currently, I'm fortunate to be part of Google, where I contribute to the development of system daemons that power the networking infrastructure behind Google's global distributed compute architecture.

During my master's program at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, I had the privilege of being advised by Professor Josiah Hanna. Together, we delved into the exciting world of reinforcement learning, focusing on its application to humanoid robots playing soccer.

In my spare time, I am an avid reader and biker. My road bike and I have seen a lot of miles together. I also play tennis in the evenings, though I'm not too good. During the weekends you can generally find me in the waters of the Pacific in one of the numerous beaches here in California.

Don't hesitate to reach out for professional collaborations or to chat about books, biking, tennis, or anything else that pops into your mind. I am always up for an ice cream and good conversations.
