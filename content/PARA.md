##### Projects

* Short term efforts that you are working on now.
* They have a beginning and an end.

##### Areas

* Long term responsibilities/areas.
* While there is no goal to reach, a standard to be maintained.

##### Resources

* Topics that may be useful in the future.
* Instead of using a dedicated folder, I prefer tags.
* I plan on storing tagged information into my daily notes.
* Any of these which are converted into full notes will be in Inbox.

##### Archives

* Inactive items from the other categories.
* Essentially contains content no longer relevant.
* This helps remove clutter from your workspace.
