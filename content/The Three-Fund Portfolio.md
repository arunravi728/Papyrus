The three-fund portfolio is popular amongst Bogleheads who are interested in a simple lazy investment strategy. It generally consists of the two basic asset classes - 

1. Stocks
1. Bonds

Generally low cost funds that represent the entire market are chosen for the portfolio. An example  ETF portfolio (similar index funds can be used as well) is as follows - 

1. Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI)
1. Vanguard Total International Stock Market Index Fund (VXUS)
1. Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND)

A potential replacement to the bond portion of the portfolio could be a high yield savings account or [Certified Deposits](./Certified%20Deposits.md).

The more interesting question would be the percentage of allocations in the three funds. The percentages would depend on the individual and their unique circumstances.
