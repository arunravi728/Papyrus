### Save

* The quickest way to affluence is to reduce your expenses.
* Saving increases your freedom both now and in the future.
* Start saving early and regularly- use the power of compounding.
* Time is a lot more important than timing, so start early.
* Don't outlive the money you saved for retirement.
* Tax minimization is an essential tool in building savings.

### Index

* Develop a simple financial plan and stick to it.
* Indexing has outperformed all but a handful of securities.
* Remember that nobody knows more than the market!
* Investing in index funds simplifies investing.
* Index funds are tax-efficient - gains are over time, and hence lesser taxes over time.
* Index funds are predictable (you will do average in the long term.
* Look into total market funds.
* Refer [Exchange Traded Funds](./Exchange%20Traded%20Funds.md).

### Diversify

* A cardinal rule of investing: Diversify.
* Buying ETFs or index funds is an automatic way to diversify.
* Diversify across securities, asset classes, markets, and across time.
* The price of a bond is inversely proportional to the interest rate.
* Diversification across time refers to not making all investments at once.
* Dollar cost averaging - regular periodic investments over time.
* A general portfolio consists of stocks and bonds.
* As you age, you end up having more bonds than stocks.
* Always rebalance your portfolio at the start of your year!
* Rebalancing might not increase returns, but it will reduce risks.

### Common Blunders

* The secret to financial success is patience, persistence, and minimizing mistakes.
* You can save time, anxiety, and money by ignoring all market forecasts.
* The best investing advice anyone can give you is to buy and hold an index fund regularly.
* If you have to sell, sell your losers as they give you tax write-offs.
* Minimize your investment cost.
* As an individual investor, avoid buying individual stocks - stick to ETFs.
* If you do consult financial advisors, stick to ones who are fee-only, avoid people who take commissions.
