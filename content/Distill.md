- Lao Tzu (Chinese Philosopher) #Productivity/NoteTaking 

* Distillation is the very heart of effective communication.
* Use progressive summarization to convert a large block of text to its basic idea.

##### Progressive Summarization

* Takes advantage of highlighting.
* The main idea is recursive highlighting.
* This is not done on note creation, rather on successive note consumptions.
* There are four layers - 
  1. Captured Notes - Original Notes.
  1. Bolded Passages - Most important part of the original notes.
  1. Highlighted Passages - Highlight important parts of the bolded passages.
  1. Executive Summary -  Only needed when the note is visited frequently.
