Self Link: [Static Typing in C++](Static%20Typing%20in%20C++.md)

* Every variable needs to have a type associated with it.
* Types allow the compiler to - 
  1. Know how much memory a variable needs.
  1. Types of values that can be stored in the variable.
  1. What operations can be performed on a variable.

C++ has two broad classes of typing - 

1. [Fundamental Types](./Fundamental%20Types.md) - these are built into the compiler.
1. [Derived Types](./Derived%20Types.md) - also called compound types.
