**Welcome to Papyrus** — my digital garden, second brain, and long-term memory that works.

Papyrus began as a personal experiment after reading [Building a Second Brain](./Building%20a%20Second%20Brain.md), and it has since become a reliable resource where I capture, organize, and connect ideas and insights - so I can focus more on discovery and less on recall. 

Feel feel to explore my collection of notes.
