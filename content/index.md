### About Me

Hi there! I’m Arun, a Software Engineer at Google in Sunnyvale, where I design low-level networking daemons that keep our AI infrastructure running.  With over 3 years of experience building distributed systems and cloud infrastructure, I have grown fond of wrestling with packet drops, race conditions, and segfaults. Before Google, I earned my Master’s in Computer Science from the University of Wisconsin–Madison and worked at Samsung Research in India.

Outside of work, you’ll find me deep in a sci-fi or fantasy epic (currently reading *Abaddon’s Gate* from *The Expanse*), cycling when the California sun cooperates, or losing track of time in an open-world RPG. I also possess the rare and questionable talent of sleeping 17 hours straight.

Thanks for stopping by - feel free to explore and connect!
