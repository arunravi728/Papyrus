Hello! I'm Arun Ravi, and welcome to **Papyrus** - my second brain. This repository consists of my notes about a variety of topics ranging from  programming to cycling to cooking recipes. I have been taking notes on Obsidian ever since I started reading [Building a Second Brain](./Building%20a%20Second%20Brain.md), and discovered the power of not having to remember every piece of information I consume. 

Feel free to explore Papyrus. Some starter landing pages you might be interested in -
