Welcome to Papyrus, my digital Second Brain! I’m Arun Ravi, and this is a curated repository of my knowledge and notes on topics that excite me, from programming to cycling. Papyrus began as a personal experiment after reading [Building a Second Brain](./Building%20a%20Second%20Brain.md), and it has since become a reliable resource where I capture, organize, and connect ideas and insights - so I can focus more on discovery and less on recall. Feel feel to explore my collection of notes.
