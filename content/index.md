### About Me

Hi there! I’m Arun, a Software Engineer at Google in Sunnyvale, where I design low-level networking daemons for Google's planet-scale AI infrastructure.  With four years of experience building distributed systems and cloud infrastructure, I have become accustomed to troubleshooting packet drops, race conditions, and segfaults. Before Google, I earned my Master’s in Computer Science from the University of Wisconsin–Madison and worked at Samsung Research in India.
