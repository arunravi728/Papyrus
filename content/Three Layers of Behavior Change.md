##### The Three Layers

1. Change in Outcomes - What you get.
1. Change in Process - What you do.
1. Change in Identity - What you believe.

##### Two Types of Change

* Outcome Based - Focus on what you want to achieve. (Most Common)
* Identity Based - Focus on who you want to be.

 > Behavior that is incongruent with the self will not last.

In order to make lasting changes to habits, we need to make lasting changes to beliefs. For example, take the way you looked. In India, you were not tidy in appearance, you did not dress neatly and did not maintain your hair. But you started taking care of your outward appearance and understood that you look so much better. It has now become second nature to take care of yourself. The habit became part of who you are, in other words, an identity change.

* The deeper a thought is tied to your identity, more the inertia to change.
* Progress requires unlearning, and editing your beliefs.
