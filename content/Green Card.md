* Green Card (GC) is the US equivalent of Permanent Residency (PR).
* Steps to get a GC - 
  1. Labor Certification (PERM)
  1. Immigration Petition (I-140)
  1. Priority Date
  1. Adjustment of Status (I-485)

##### PERM

* Google performs market tests to see if there are any qualified US workers for the job.
* Need to file PERM Labor Certification Form (ETA Form 9089).
* Google currently does Batch PERM which reduces PERM waiting times.
  * Faster than individual PERM.
  * Labor tested for most common Google roles.

* Look into [EB2 NIW](./EB2%20NIW.md) to skip this step.

##### Visa Bulletin

* Each month the Visa bulletin is updated.
* Contains cutoff dates for various priority dates.
* Priority date is set when PERM is filed.
