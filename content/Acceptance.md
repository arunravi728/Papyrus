Acceptance means being open to your thoughts, feelings, and circumstances as they are. It doesn’t mean approving, wanting, liking, or giving in. It simply means letting go of trying to control when control isn’t working for you.

To accept reality, we can be more aware of the following - 

1. Thoughts / Feelings
1. Physical Sensations
1. Actions

 > Naming your emotion helps with acceptance.

The first step towards acceptance is knowing when we are not accepting reality. This happens when we start thinking about how things should be different, in other words, we start thinking something is not fair.

When you don't accept reality, you generally end up frustrated or angry. Remember that anger is just a mask over another emotion.
