With President Trump's election in the 2024 US presidential race, Bitcoin has risen around 17% in a week of the election. This note contains my musings on why I am still skeptical of cryptocurrencies.

### What is Money?

We started using money around 5000 years ago, before which we used a barter system to trade goods of value. The keyword here is **value**. For example, a simple barter exchange would be when someone trades salt for grains. Here, the value arises from people's *requirements*.

The process of obtaining goods one did not produce allowed for specialization among people. I assume goods that were harder to make (requiring more skill) had fewer people creating them, thus leading to an increase in value. In this case, the value arises from the *scarcity* of resources. People who produced goods trusted by a large group created brands. Well-known or "trusted" brands would naturally be of higher value. In this case, the value was created by *trust*.

An immediate problem with the barter system is that to obtain an item of need; an individual would need to find someone willing to trade that item for something the individual produces. This is referred to as the double coincidence of wants.

#### Early Money

People did not start using paper currencies as we do today but rather used rare and precious metals (most commonly gold and silver) as an intermediary to trade goods. The value of gold, silver, and other precious metals arose from their *scarcity*. The introduction of precious metals as an intermediary allowed for two things - 

1. No longer were the requirements of people left up to chance.
1. People were able to store value by accumulating the intermediaries, allowing them to build wealth and carry it into the future.

A major con of using precious metals as currency was that these metals were heavy and difficult to carry around. It also took up a lot of space when stored and could be stolen if not safely guarded.

#### Paper Money

The use of paper money began when people realized *trust* could be leveraged to create value. Individuals began exchanging goods with certificates of credit. These certificates promised the holder of a certain quantity of gold that could be exchanged for the certificate. This is known as the Gold Standard. Soon, heads of state were able to centralize this process of issuing paper money, which could be exchanged for some quantity of gold. Here, *trust* was backed by the *scarcity* of the underlying resource.

As people started to trust the paper currency more, governments realized that large groups of people would not exchange for gold at the same time. This allowed them to safely print more money, allowing governments to lend to businesses at cheaper interest rates. This, in turn, allowed the businesses to grow and led to the economy performing well.

### The Dollar

Towards the end of World War 2, the US and its allies entered into an agreement that made the currencies of each ally exchangeable for some amount of US dollars. Since the US dollar was backed by gold, the currencies of US allies also became backed by gold, even if these individual countries did not own large stockpiles of the metal. This allowed the US dollar to be the default currency used for global trade. Any nation that owned US dollars could exchange it for gold with the US (note this exchange for gold was between nations and could not be done between individual US citizens and the government).

Following the end of the war, the US economy did very well. Since the US dollar was pegged to both gold and the currency of other nations, it did not increase with the growing economy. This allowed other nations to buy large amounts of the undervalued US dollar. However, in the 1970s, the US economy was not healthy due to high borrowing by the government. The US dollar, at this point, became overvalued, and countries started exchanging large quantities of dollars for gold with the US. The US placed a temporary pause in the convertibility of dollars to gold, fearing insufficient gold in its treasury to honor all incoming requests. This temporary pause later turned into an elimination of the gold standard.
