##### Overview

Note taking provides a practical medium through which you can transform any new knowledge you gain into actionable insights.

##### Methodology

There are generally two broad but similar families of thought regarding note taking - 

1. [Zettelkasten](./Zettelkasten.md) - Age old method.
1. [Second Brain](./Second%20Brain.md) - A modern method, mostly focussed on digital note taking.

##### Bi-Directional Linking

* It is essentially the concept of linking notes together.
* It allows you to create notes keeping in mind how you want to stumble onto this note in the future.

We get introduced to note taking in school before tests, where we used to note down information that would be questioned in tests. We then never referenced these notes again. Knowledge in this case was disposable.
