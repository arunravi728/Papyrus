 > For investors as a whole, returns decrease as motion increases!

* Occam's Razor - When there are multiple solutions to a problem, choose the simplest one.
* The simplest way to win in the stock market is to own everything!
* The simplest way to hold every stock is to have a total stock market portfolio.
  * Best achieved through an index fund.

### Investment Costs

* Investors as a group get what they don't pay for. So if you don't pay, you get everything.
* The costs of financial intermediation are very high. Make sure your costs are meager.
* Over the long term, compounding returns are overwhelmed by compounding costs.
* Index funds are tax-efficient. They allow investors to defer capital gains until they sell.
  * Delaying selling allows turnover to remain low, leading to lower taxes.
* Investment return = Return - Tax - Investment Costs - Inflation --> Minimize your costs.
* In a future with low returns, low-cost, tax-efficient funds remain good investment vehicles.
  * The lower the returns, the worse the effect of investment costs on real returns.
* Select index funds without sales loads (commissions).
* Low-cost index funds outperform the average actively managed funds in less efficient markets.

 > The winning formula for investing success is owning the entire stock market through an index fund and then doing nothing. Just stay the course.

### Fixed-Income Securities

Fixed-income securities include bonds, money market funds, and HYSAs. The rates produced by these securities are directly related to the interest rates.

#### Bonds

* Long-dated bonds are more volatile but provide higher returns than short-dated bonds.
* Bonds represent debt; bonds default if the interest for the underlying securities isn't paid.
* There are three major classes of bonds - 
  1. Taxable corporate and government bonds.
  1. Tax-exempt municipal bonds.
  1. US Treasury Bills.
* Always avoid bond funds with sales loads.

#### Money Market Funds

* Money Market Funds are short-term bond funds with uniform high credit quality.
* With short maturities, high credit quality, and diversified portfolios, money market funds become commodities.
* They are not FDIC-insured like HYSAs.
