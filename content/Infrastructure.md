Self Link: [Infrastructure](Infrastructure.md)

Distributed systems is basically providing infrastructure for applications. The different types of infrastructure that can be provided are - 

1. Storage
1. Networking (What I work on at Google)
1. Compute
1. [ML Systems](ML%20Systems.md) (more recent, same as compute maybe?)

A really well designed distributed systems would be able to hide the fact that the underlying infrastructure is distributed -> Note this is very hard to achieve.

Infrastructure in general needs to be - 

1. Scalable
1. Available
1. Recoverable
1. Replicated
1. Consistent
