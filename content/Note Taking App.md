* There are 4 archetypes of users for taking notes - 
  1. Architect - Need a clear structure.
  1. Gardener - More spontaneous.
  1. Librarian - More of a collector/categorizer.
  1. Student - Mixture of the above.

I am more of an Architect, but I want to think more like a Gardener. Also I really like how cool Obsidian is, some of the benefits are - 

* Super secure as everything is local.
* Easy to sync across Apple devices. 
* The community plugins are amazing. 
* Everything is plain text, making it super fast.
* Closest to the one app to rule them all approach.

Personally I would recommend either Notion or Obsidian -

I did not go with Notion as I thought it was too complicated and had too many options, and I spent a lot of time just deciding which template I wanted.
