* Information is a fundamental building block of everything we do.
* According to NYT, the average person consumes 34 GB of data daily.

 > 
 > What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention...

- Herbert Simon (American Economist and Cognitive Psychologist) #Career/Attention

[Building a Second Brain](./Building%20a%20Second%20Brain.md#^Chapter2) says that we have 5 day work weeks. But spend one of those days on average looking for misplaced information. This is very familiar to my first two months of full time at Google where I was inundated with a lot of new information which I could not get my head around. I took notes in a book and could not understand how something linked to something else. I was basically very lost.
