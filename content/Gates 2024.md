\#MentalHealth 

 > 
 > My friend the late Hans Rosling used to say that “things can be bad *and* getting better.” It’s a good reminder that progress is not only possible but happening every day.

 > When I was my kids’ age, I didn’t believe in vacations or weekends. But as I got older—and especially since I became a father—I realized there is more to life than work.

\#Career/AI 

 > 
 > In a world with limited resources, you have to find ways to maximize impact. Innovation is the key to getting the most out of every dollar spent. And artificial intelligence is about to accelerate the rate of new discoveries at a pace we’ve never seen before.

 > 
 > The work that will be done over the next year is setting the stage for a massive technology boom later this decade.
