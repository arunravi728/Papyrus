Self Link: [Links vs Tags](Links%20vs%20Tags.md)

##### Links

* Use topics, concepts and research.
* Essentially used to store information.
* Useful for networking many notes and navigating ideas.

##### Tags

* Mainly used for searchability.
* Use for categorization for a specific intent.
* Useful for grouping topics later down the road.
* Should not be too general.
* You will mostly use this in the daily note.
