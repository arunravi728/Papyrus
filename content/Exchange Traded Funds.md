* An ETF tracks multiple stocks or securities.
* Can be used to track an index (eg, S&P 500).
* They may track different industries, sectors, or types of companies.
* ETFs carry the risk of the underlying securities being held.

### ETFs vs Mutual Funds

* Both give investors a mechanism to diversify.
* ETFs can be traded at any time of day, while [Mutual Funds](./Mutual%20Funds.md) can be traded once a day.
* ETFs are cheaper as mutual funds are managed by fund managers (require a fee?).
