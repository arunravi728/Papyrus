Software architectures are built with a variety of tools, each with its strengths and weaknesses. But, underlying these new frameworks and tools are three fundamental concepts that all computer systems must observe -

* [Reliability](./Reliability.md) - Ability of a system to work correctly even when things go wrong.
* [Scalability](./Scalability.md) - Ability of a system to handle increased loads.
* [Maintainability](./Maintainability.md) - Ability of a system to be simple, operable, and evolvable.
