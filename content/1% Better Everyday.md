share: true

* Effects of habits (good/bad) are only seen 5 to 10 years later.
  * Repeating 1% errors leads to toxic results.
* Success is a product of daily habits, not once-in-a-lifetime transformations.
  * You get what you repeat.

 > Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy.
